# SQL

Database schemas and queries for practice and analysis.

## Contents
- `schema/pizza.sql` — schema for menu, recipe, items tables
- `data/pizza_sample.sql` — sample data for pizzas, ingredients, and recipes
- `queries/pizza_practice.sql` — practice queries with subqueries, joins, and aggregations

## Function
This project models a **pizza shop database** and explores queries for:
- Correlated subqueries (e.g., max ingredient amount per ingredient)
- Nested queries (e.g., pizzas from the same country)
- Joins (e.g., ingredient types for a pizza)
- Aggregations with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- Comparative analysis (e.g., pizzas more expensive than *stagiony*)

## Data Analysis with sql
- Which ingredients dominate in recipes
- Which pizzas share the same origin country
- Revenue potential of different pizzas
- Average prices across countries
